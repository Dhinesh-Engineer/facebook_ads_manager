# Data Fetching Mechanism for Facebook AdsManager

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of digital marketing, data reigns supreme. For businesses, Facebook's AdsManager is a key advertising platform, unlocking the potential of their campaigns demands the efficient extraction and utilization of data. This project is dedicated to the development of a powerful data fetching mechanism in Facebook Graph API. This mechanism will serve as the backbone for acquiring, organizing, and harnessing critical advertising campaign data. Through the power of the Facebook Graph API, businesses will be equipped to elevate their advertising strategies, enabling data-driven decisions and analytics for reporting purposes.

## Facebook Ads Manager

Facebook Ads Manager is a powerful advertising platform provided by Facebook that allows businesses and advertisers to create, manage, and optimize their advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and features to help businesses reach their target audience, track campaign performance, and achieve their marketing objectives.

## Facebook Graph API

The Facebook Graph API is a powerful and versatile tool provided by Facebook that allows developers to programmatically interact with and access various data and functionality on the Facebook platform. It is named "Graph API" because it represents the social graph of Facebook, which encompasses users, pages, groups, events, and more, as interconnected nodes.

### Access to Facebook Graph API

Access to the Facebook Graph API requires authentication through access tokens and credentials. Here are the steps to obtain the necessary access tokens and credentials:

1. **Create a Facebook App**
   
   - Go to the Facebook for Developers website: [https://developers.facebook.com/](https://developers.facebook.com/)
   - Login with your Facebook account.
   - Click on "My Apps" and then select "Create App" to create a new Facebook App.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. This will involve providing basic information about your app.

2. **Obtain App Credentials:**
   
   Once your app is created, you'll need to obtain the following credentials.
   
   - **App ID**: This is a unique identifier for your Facebook App.
   - **App Secret**: A secret key that should be kept confidential. It's used for server-side authentication.
   
   You can find these credentials in the "Settings" section of your Facebook App within the Facebook for Developers platform.

3. **Marketing API Tools:**

   Adding the "Marketing API Tools" product to your Facebook app involves configuring the necessary permissions and settings to enable your app to access the Facebook Marketing API.

4. **Python**
   
   For Python apps, the SDK is distributed as a pypi module, so make sure to have pip installed.

   **Install the SDK**
   
   Install the SDK with the following command:
   
   ```
   pip install facebook_business
   ```

   **Create a Project File**
   
   Create the `test.py` file with the following content. Replace `{app-id}`, `{access-token}`, `{appsecret}`, and `{adaccount-id}` with your values.

   ```python
   from facebook_business.api import FacebookAdsApi
   from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount

   my_app_id = '{app-id}'
   my_app_secret = '{appsecret}'
   my_access_token = '{access-token}'
   FacebookAdsApi.init(my_app_id, my_app_secret, my_access_token)
   my_account = AdAccount('act_{adaccount-id}')
   campaigns = my_account.get_campaigns()
   print(campaigns)
   ```

   **Test Your Install**
   
   Test your install with the following command:

   ```
   python test.py
   ```

   You should see the result in your terminal window. If it complains about an expired token, request a new Page Access Token and retry.

5. **Facebook Graph API:**
   
   You can discover the Graph API Explorer in the "Tools" section, which allows you to set up your apps and obtain their access tokens for accessing the Facebook Graph API.

6. **Set Up App Permissions.**

   Under "Permissions and Features," configure the permissions your app needs to access through the Graph API. For AdsManager data, you might need permissions related to advertising and analytics.

7. **Obtain a User Access Token.**

   Submit your app for review if required by Facebook for the specific permissions you've requested. This step is necessary for certain sensitive data access.
